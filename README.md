# Project 3: Link Analysis

This project implements PageRank-based ranking methods to analyze influence and prestige among books in the Amazon Books Review dataset.  
Books are linked through shared reviewers, forming a co-review network on which several PageRank variants are applied — including personalized, temporal decay, and reviewer reputation weighting.  
Results highlight how popularity, credibility, and recency shape prestige dynamics in large-scale user–item networks.
